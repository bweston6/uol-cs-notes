Issues that encryption aims to solve:

* Incorrect relaying of information.
	* This has partial solutions.
* Eavesdropping on information.
	* This has many solutions.
	
## Solutions to Eavesdropping

* Control your environment such that there is no possibility of eavesdropping.
* Use a different language.
* Speak in code (using different keywords to create plausible deniability).

## Solutions for Written Text

* Sealing the message using a seal (not suitable for electronic communications).
* Prevent messages being read by non-recipients:
	* Hide the message.

### Steganography
This is the hiding of messages in non-secret messages.

* Hide information in the least significant bits of an image or audio file.

### Obscurity
Hiding the message is just security through obscurity:

* This is not suitable for e-commerce.


## Cryptography
Historical encryption schemes usually fall into two categories:

* Transposition - change the order and location of symbols.
	
	This technique is not used in modern methods as it often has significant redundant data and involves moving the letters physically.
	{:.info}
* Substitution - replace symbols by other symbols.


### Transposition
#### Scytale

1. Make two sticks with the same diameter:
	* One for sender, one for receiver.
1. To encrypt - wrap the strip of paper around the stick and write on surfaces next to each other:
	* Fill other surfaces with random letters or place multiple messages at different starting points.
1. To decrypt - wrap the strip of paper around the stick and read the surfaces next to each-other.

#### Grille
Similar to Scytale:

1. Cut pieces out of paper, making two copies:
	* One for sender and receiver.
1. Encrypt by placing the paper with holes on top of the empty paper and write on exposed surfaces.
	* Continue on open spaces or fill with random letters.
1. Decrypt by placing the holes on top of the message and reading the correct letters.

### Substitution
#### Caesar Cipher
1. Replace every letter by the same letter shifted by $n$.

This has the following **weaknesses**:

* Brute-force as there are only 26 encryption keys.
* Known plain-text attack if you know one plain-text, cipher-text, pair then you can find the key.
* Chosen plain-text attack if you can trick the key-holder to encrypt plain-text of your choosing.
* Cipher-text only attack by using frequency analysis.

##### Information Leakage
Even if you can't decrypt it you can still see the following:

* Length of the message:
	* Can be avoided if you use padding.
	* You will always know an upper-bound message of the length even with padding.
* Similar plain-text gives similar cipher-text.

### Mono-alphabetic Ciphers
This method replaces every letter with some other letter. 

The benefit over Caesar cipher is that:

* It is not nearly as easy to brute force:
	
	$$
	\text{keys}=26!
	$$
	
	This is still very easy to brute force with a computer.

### Polygraphic/alphabetic Ciphers

Polygraphic Cipher
: Operate on groups of symbols.

Polyalphabetic Ciphers
: May encrypt one (group of) symbol(s) into multiple different ones.

#### Polygraphic Cipher
They encrypt groups of symbols like so:

```
th is is th em es sa ge
```

Each grouping of two letter maps onto:

* Different groups of 2 letter.
* A dedicated symbol

The key **size** for a cipher with group size $n$ is:

$$
26^n
$$

as opposed to 26 for mono-alphabetic.

Compared to the previous ciphers:

* Less vulnerable to known plain-text attack.
* Significantly less vulnerable to cipher text only attacks.
* Less vulnerable to brute force.
* Far more inconvenient.

Many current encryption schemes can be classed as polygraphic ciphers. With RSA $n>512$.

#### Polyalphabetic Ciphers
Replace one symbol by one other symbol, but not always the same one (like multiple mono-alphabetic ciphers at the same time).

You can create a password by using 26 preset alphabets (schema). The password of length 26 then indicates where to start on each line.

Vign√®re cipher is an example of this where 26 Caesar ciphers are used in order.

Compared to previous ciphers:

* Brute force is not feasible.
* Known plain-text is somewhat vulnerable.
* Vulnerable to chosen plain-text.
* Practically invulnerable to frequency analysis.

To be secure we need to change the password often otherwise the scheme is only as secure as the key-length of the password.
